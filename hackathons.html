        <p>After attending Starter Hacks this past weekend, I have decided to compare my experiences at my first two Hackathons. I attended Hack The North in September 2018, a prestigious technology conference that draws students from across North America. Conversely, Starter Hacks is a hackathon catered towards first-year students, emphasizing the hackathon process itself rather than the final product. </p>
        
        <p>My computer science journey began at the start of grade 12. Somewhat reluctantly, I added ICS4U, an introduction to computer science, acknowledging that I would be ill-prepared to enter engineering without any experience whatsoever with programming. This course had a grade 11 prerequisite, and as a result I had to catch up a considerable amount during the first couple weeks of September. After a month or two, I had drawn level with the rest of my classmates. As I gained experience with Java, I began to get increasingly interested with computer science, putting more time into it than other courses despite it not being a “top six” class. Furthermore, upon the conclusion of the term I had one of the highest averages and had substantial experience with Java. </p>
        
        <p>When I entered Hack The North, I was only a couple weeks into my university career and with only my high school coding knowledge. Consequently, many other coders there were a league above me in terms of familiarity and proficiency in software development. However, I still was able to develop greatly as a programmer by attending the workshops and chatting with the companies stationed there. A great perk was receiving tons of merchandise, such as Microsoft socks, Firebase shirts and Facebook pins! Unfortunately, I still felt a bit disconnected by the hackathon by not completing a project with the same caliber as the other teams. Originally, I had a team set with three other first-years, but two of them were sick and so I worked mainly on my own. I was able to construct a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that attempted to predict what the player would use and beat them.</p>

        <p>At Starter Hacks, I formed a team with four of my best friends in biomedical engineering. Although the companies and workshops situated there may not have been at the same caliber as Hack The North, Starter Hacks was still an extremely valuable experience for me because being on a versatile team gave me the platform to learn and grow in my front-end skills. We decided to make a location-based game called Mikioma, aimed to maximize user retention by providing a strategic component and elaborate content. After pitching the product and hearing both positive and constructive feedback, we have decided to continue working on the game. Currently, we have a basic graphics on Unity and geo-mapping capabilities courtesy of MapBox’s API. The promotional website that I made for the game can be found here.</p>
    
        <p>Overall, both hackathons were valuable to my software development in unique ways: Hack The North helped build my programming foundation and Starter Hacks was the first real opportunity for me to showcase my growing software. After these two hackathons, you will definitely find me at many more in the future!</p>

        <p>My first term of university finished as rapidly as it began. After a seemingly never-ending grind for twelve weeks, I found myself at the conclusion of my first term. Over the course of the term, I underwent massive personal growth, from my ability to communicate effectively with others to managing my time exceptionally. During high school, I found that I insatiably fixated on my upcoming school tasks, almost making my whole life my school.
             However, a new environment coupled with a seemingly insurmountable level of work led me to truly emphasize what tasks to prioritize and realize much work is ‘enough’. Additionally, during high school, I often was too shy or introverted to make lengthy conversations in uncomfortable situations. However, a resolve to change this situation and a welcoming cohort of like-minded people gave me the courage to become more spontaneous and extroverted. In order to accomplish this, I began having ‘pillars’ of people who I knew I could easily and comfortably talk to. Steadily and gradually, I extended these pillars until I had a sustainable platform of communication. </p>
     
        <p>A massive new experience for me was living with a roommate for the first time. My roommate, Kevin, is a computer science major from Sudbury. We both share a passion for computers and have strong work ethics. In fact, you often might see us asking each other questions on math or computer science. Living with a roommate was a great transition to me because it forced me to be more responsible, organized, and mature.
             In high school I was used to having my own personal space; as a result, now I act considering how it could affect him. For example, if I am studying late and he is trying to sleep, I will try to study outside of the room. Overall, although I applied for a single room, living in a double room greatly forced me to transition more into becoming an independent adult.  </p>
        
        <p>During the first couple weeks of the term, I was overwhelmed with the sheer number of design teams and other clubs being offered at the university. During high school, I often felt pressured to sign up for every single club, council, and other opportunity thinking that it would ‘pad my resume’. 
            However, at Waterloo I realized that the only catalyst for me joining teams or clubs was self-interest for what they brought forth. After much hesitation and thinking, I decided to join Engineering Ambassadors, Biomechatronics and a couple intramural teams.</p>
        
        <p>Firstly, being active and playing sports is an essential aspect of my persona; consequently, I knew that I had to join several teams for a forced break from studying and an opportunity to exercise. In fact, I joined system design engineering’s soccer team, my residence floor’s basketball team, and my program’s ultimate frisbee team. It was truly on these teams that I made a lot of my friends and had some of my greatest highlights of the term.
         For example, after a rather disastrous season component of our ultimate frisbee league, we were able to band together and win the playoffs as the lowest seed.  In retrospect, having played competitive soccer for many years, this was really the first time that I could play with the priority on making friends and having fun instead of winning.</p>
    
        <p>During my grade 12 year, I shadowed a biomedical student at Waterloo. This was a massive factor in me choosing Waterloo, and for this reason I decided to be an Engineering Ambassador. I have since given several shadow days myself to promising high school students. The knowledge that I am helping those in similar situations to me make me feel invigoratingly wholesome. Lastly, I joined biomechatronics for many of the same reasons that I chose biomedical engineering: a passion for maths and physical coupled with a newfound love for biology during my senior years, as well as a great sense of satisfaction that I could tangibly improve society and human welfare.
             On biomechatronics, we worked on creating 3D printed hands for an individual who unfortunately lost his hand and forearm in a snowboarding incident. This was something that I never imagined I would be capable of undertaking a year or two ago. </p>
    
        <p>An unexpected passion that I discovered during 1A was for programming and making games with coding. During my first three years of secondary school I abrasively dismissed the idea of taking computer science courses and only reluctantly took it in grade 12 when realizing I may be at a disadvantage without it in engineering. Since the course had a grade 11 pre-requisite that I did not take, I spent much of the course playing catch-up, learning material from online resources on my own. However, by the end of the course my dedication payed off, resulting in me achieving the second-highest mark on the final exam. 
            Furthermore, arriving at Waterloo, I found myself wholeheartedly intrigued by the medical applications of software and AI. In fact, I am planning to do at least one co-op in such a field as a result.  </p>
        
        <p>Another event leading to self-growth was accidentally forgetting to submit an assignment for my communications course. I had finished this assignment probably a week before its deadline, except for one or two minor details. However, the stress of upcoming final examinations led me to uncharacteristically procrastinate the assignment until the day that it was due. Unfortunately, spottiness in the campus Wi-Fi caused me to study some programming first; by the time I realized I still had to submit the assignment, it was a few minutes past the deadline. In horror, I saw that the Dropbox had already closed, and frantically emailed the professors. After no response, I began to stress, considering the gravity of a zero on this heavily weighted assignment. However, the next day I booked a meeting with the professor, and I explained to them the situation. We agreed that I could submit the assignment at a 20% penalty. 
            From this incident, I learned that even a few seconds of lapse or procrastination can lead to monumental catastrophe. In a way, I am glad that this event happened, so I avoid errors like this in potentially more important terms or even co-op work terms. </p>
        
        <p>Well, that’s a bit about me and my first term at university! Sorry I couldn’t cover everything that happened, but I hope to add more blog posts soon!</p>

        <p>When I ask University of Waterloo students why they selected their university, I often receive one-word responses that seem to justify any decision: <b>coop</b>. It’s a grand allure that attracts the most ambitious and driven young adults in Ontario to Waterloo; the potential to earn enough money, while still being a student, to pay all tuitions is unheard of. And so, as I approach the application process for my first co-op, I have decided to reflect on why I chose Waterloo.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The two biggest reasons that I chose Waterloo was its biomedical engineering program and its co-op. During my childhood, I always was oriented towards mathematics and physics. As a result, I always knew that I would pursue a career in a scientific field. However, it was not until my senior years of high school when I took biology that I also began to become submersed into biology. Hence, biomedical engineering presented itself as a fusion of my two interests. Firstly, not every engineering school offers a direct-entry biomedical engineering program, especially not one with the caliber like Waterloo. As a result, I really knew that as soon as I wanted to study biomedical engineering I would want to go to Waterloo. Additionally, given that biomed is such an interdisciplinary program, I felt that having six co-op work terms while being an undergrad student would be a great way to determine which industry I would want to pursue.</p>
        <p>I also strongly considered MacMaster for its integrated biomedical engineering/health care and U of T for engineering science. Although engineering science is one of the best programs in the country, I felt that I wanted to go to a program where innovation and biology were also promoted. Also, living in a city other than my hometown Toronto was something that I believed would boost my university experience. MacMaster was another program I deeply considered because it is a cornerstone for health and research in Canada and I had several friends going there as well. In fact, many of these friends are still hanging out and will be living in the same house next year. However, I think personally the self-growth that I have experience this year would not have been elicited if I was still around familiar faces. Also, in the iBiomed program, I was very certain that I would opt to choose the engineering stream, which is a department that does not match my interests quite as much as Waterloo’s.</p>
        <p>Picking a university should not be about the prestige of the university/program or its ability to give you a six-figure salary but should instead be done while considering your personality and interests. Waterloo, being a primarily academic university, is really structured for being who enjoy learning and studying. Consequently, if you are reading this and don’t really like studying a lot or the idea of school, I would greatly recommend considering a different university. However, I personally enjoy learning new things and keeping busy with a steady mix of academics and extracurriculars. Overall, I feel confident that I made the correct decision based on my interests and would not have chosen a different university if I could choose again. </p>
    
        <p>I hope that if you are reading this and are still decision on your university that this was somewhat of use to you.</p>

      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>Hey! Thanks for coming to my website! I am a self-motivated, dedicated biomedical engineering student at the University Of Waterloo.
        I am deeply fascinated by human and artificial systems, as well as the interaction between the two. I aspire to carry this passion into
        making a lasting impact on the biomedical/software industry. Feel free to check out my interests, blog and projects! </p>
